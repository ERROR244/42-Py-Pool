What is a piscine?
Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (modules), and
with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on.

# Preamble
Here is what Wikipedia has to say about Python:

  - Python is a genus of constricting snakes in the Pythonidae family native to the tropics
and subtropics of the Eastern Hemisphere.

  - The name Python was proposed by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous
flecked snakes. Currently, 10 python species are recognized as valid taxa.

  - Three formerly considered python subspecies have been promoted, and a new species
recognized.
